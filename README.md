# N-Bit-Kogge-Stone-Adder

Kogge-Stone adder is considered to be the fastest state-of-the-art adder structure that has been developed so far. It has the least delay as compared to any other adder. This adder is a part of a class of adders known as Carry Prefix Adders (CPAs). Other famous adders like the Brent-Kung adder or the Han-Carlson adder (both being CPA adders) sacrifice a little bit of speed for lesser area and power consumption.

This project contains the Verilog implementation of N-Bit Kogge-Stone adder. In order to understand the code of the N-bit adder module, it is advised to first go through the codes of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit modules of the Kogge-Stone adder (make sure to use testbench modules accordingly).

Note: N should be a power of 2.

The results have been compiled with N = 64.
